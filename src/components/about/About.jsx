      <p>
      Just finished my second college semester, focusing on frontend and React. I'm comfortable with:

      Creating webpage structures with HTML, styling with CSS, and adding interactivity using JavaScript.
      Building dynamic user interfaces with React components and JSX.
      Managing component data using useState and handling updates with useEffect.
      Navigating between pages using React Router.
      Fetching data from APIs using Axios or fetch.
      Styling interfaces with CSS and exploring CSS-in-JS libraries.
      Exploring libraries like Material-UI and Bootstrap for consistent designs.
      Getting a grip on React Context for app-wide state management.
      Testing with Jest and React Testing Library.
      Collaborating with Git for version control.
      Looking forward to delving into server-side rendering and backend concepts next. Just the beginning, and I'm excited to keep growing in the frontend world!      </p>
